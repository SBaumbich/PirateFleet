##Project Overview
An iOS App that challenges the computer to a Battleship-esque game, while learning about data structures in Swift.

##Skills Learned
* Higher Order Functions
* Data Structures
* Opperations & Expressions
* UILocalNotifications
* UIKit

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
This app utilizes many of Apple's built-in libraries to demonstrate how to write elegant swift code without reinventing the wheel. Swift's higher order functions were used extensively throughout this project in order to construct the map grid and many computational game algorithms.
